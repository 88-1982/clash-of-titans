# Name of Student:DeAunte Hall

# Name of Project: Clash of titans

## Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
### My project will allow the user to find their favorite super hero and the super hero's powers


## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal: 

### My project will use an API to find selected hero to find thier stats and powers out of over 700 heros

* The user should be able to select their favorite super hero.

* Once hero is selected by the user an image of the selected hero will be displayed in the DOM (browser)

* The user will now have the ablility to veiw hero's stats.  (Place of birth,Super Powers, Nationality,date of appearance etc)

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

React
React-DOM
Redux
JSX
SCSS
Node.js
prop-types
npm
Javascript
LocalStorage
API

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

### When I build out my project I would like to have a RPG style battle with the super heros that user has selected.

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?



### At this point I will have to do more resarch on how I can build out the battle between the selected heros.

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

### I am trying to use technologies that have not been taught in class to challages myself a bit, such as scss,axios,sinon and enzyme. I hope to be able to incorporate them in my capstone project

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
